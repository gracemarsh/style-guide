[Techdegree Project 4 - Web style guide](https://gracemarsh.github.io/style-guide/)

## Running this project.

To recompile the sass run:`

```bash
sass scss/styles.scss css/styles.css --watch
```

In this project I converted CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. I also stored repeated values (length units, colors, etc.) throughout the CSS as Sass variables.
